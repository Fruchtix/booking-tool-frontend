IDEAS:

- tattooer table vs inlcude tattooer inside studio table

TODO: to think about: does the user need an account? for the chat
       => first thoughts:
           - yes to connect the chat with a specific user (including email adress
           - but only with email => dont use password for it
           - send token to mail each time a chat is send => user does not need to login
TODO: does the user need to verify the email? => yes, user needs to confirm once!


TODO:

- when creating free timeslot check if other timeslot is during that time
- maybe move confirm modal into original modal and don't have two modals open


- get studio url
- get studio artists
